Instruments, in an econometric sense, have always fascinated me. For one, they have alwways seemed
to me like a statistical concoction, a construct, a design that makes sense to the head but feels
wrong to the stomach. It doesn't help that the usual instruments used are rainfalls, droughts, and
kinds of other natural phenomenon, and you wonder, can this really work? 

I write this in the context of my own research, where I first wanted to look at the causal effect of
the Nepal's Maoist Insurgency on children's education, and after finding out that the research was
already done (like most of all research ideas), I opted to try and estimate the labor market
implications of the said Civil War. Again, this research was already in print as well, but only for
women's work. While reading the research by Menon and Rodgers, the use of the instrument bugged me
again. 

The use of the instrument in the paper is as follows:

1. Nepal's districts are divided into treatment and control groups (conflict afflicted and not
   afflicted) based on the proportion of their forest cover. The idea here is, districts with higher
   forest cover were fertile grounds for higher conflict incidences and conflict deaths, and
   therefore, if districts are divided such that districts with higher than 75th percentile forest
   cover are treatment, the treatment/control mechanism is exogenous. The paper shows that forest
   cover explains 25% variation in conflict deaths across districts. They say they are inspired by
   Angrist's paper on exogenous change in cocoa plantation and violence. 

My doubts concerning this are:

1. First, conflict deaths is clearly not a binary indicator. 


[ ] Do forest cover treatment and control.
