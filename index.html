      Description: This paper studies the labor market
      consequences of Nepalese Civil War (1996 -2006 A.D.). Using two
      rounds of Nepal Labor Force Survey (NLFS) data, the paper uses
      Doubly Robust DiD (DrDid) to assess the effect of
      conflict intensity (as proxied by conflict deaths) on employment
      measures.  Being in a conflict-intense region had minimal effect
      on the probability of being employed, although these regions saw
      reduced work hours.

      <b>Exogenous Variation in Family Size : Sex Composition of Children and the third birth. </b>
      <a href = "https://github.com/suhishan/suhishan.github.io/blob/main/Exogenous%20variation%20in%20family%20size%7C%20Suhishan%20Bhandari%20.pdf">[Link]</a>

	    Description: First paper as part of the course Applied Economics Research 
	    (Written as a third year undergraduate student). The paper looks at whether 
	    families whether families who had two girls as their first two children
	    tended to conceive a third child more than those families who had two boys 
	    as their first two children in the context of Nepal. This paper was in part
	    a replication of Angrist and Evan's 1996 paper "Children and Their Parents'
	    Labor Supply: Evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size".
