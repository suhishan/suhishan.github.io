      Abstract: This paper studies the labor market
      consequences of Nepalese Civil War (1996 -2006 A.D.). Using two
      rounds of Nepal Labor Force Survey (NLFS) data, the article uses
      Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) DiD to assess the effect of
      conflict intensity (as proxied by conflict deaths) on employment
      measures.  Being in a conflict-intense region had minimal effect
      on the probability of being employed, although these regions saw
      reduced work hours. In rural areas, high- afflicted regions had
      increased likelihood of being self-employed.
