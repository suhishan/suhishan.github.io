  I am Suhishan Bhandari, a recent Economics undergraduate. I write about my interests here, which are mainly short projects
  on applied statistics using Bayesian Inference in R, Stan and Python. Below is a list of some of my writing and projects.

          Premier League Match Predictions using Bayesian Hierarchical Models.
        </a>
        <p>
        The goal of this blog is to predict the final gameweek (gameweek 38) of the Premier League 2023/24
        season. To accomplish this task: two models are used a) Complete Pooling model and b) Hierarchical
        Model.

          How to use hurdle lognormal likelihood to model outcomes?
        </a>
        <p>
        The goal of this blog is to outline how, in response to natural constraints in a variable like <i>work hours
        </i> (the variable is always positive with lots of zeros), we can employ a hurdle log-normal model for likelihood
        instead of the usual normal distribution assumption.

          Can Forest cover work as an instrument for conflict incidence?
        </a>

        <p>
        In this blog, I try and incorporate uncertainity into the well-used and establish relationship between Forest
        cover and conflict incidence in the Conflict Literature. This is done to see whether one can indeed use Forest 
        Cover as a valid instrument, especially if analyzed with a causal design in mind.

          Strategic Voting in Nepal's Local Level Mayoral Elections.
        </a>
    <p>
      What was the extent of competition and tactical voting in Nepal's two Local Level Mayoral 
      Elections in 2017 and 2022? The blog estimates the <i>Effective number of parties</i> and the 
      Divergenian Equlibria.
